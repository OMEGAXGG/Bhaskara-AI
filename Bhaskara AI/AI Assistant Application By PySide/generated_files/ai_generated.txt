To create a server, you'll need to follow these general steps using a programming language and a web framework of your choice. Here's a simple guide using Node.js and Express.js:

1. Install Node.js: Go to https://nodejs.org/ and download the latest version for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions.

2. Create a new project: Open a terminal or command prompt and create a new directory for your project:
```
mkdir my-server
cd my-server
```

3. Initialize the project: Run `npm init -y` to create a package.json file with default settings.

4. Install Express.js: Run `npm install express --save` to add Express.js as a dependency.

5. Create a new file `app.js` and write the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

6. Start the server: Run `node app.js` in the terminal or command prompt.

7. Test the server: Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the message "Hello World!".

Now you have a simple server up and running using Node.js and Express.js. You can expand this server by adding more routes, handling different HTTP methods, using middleware, and connecting to a database.

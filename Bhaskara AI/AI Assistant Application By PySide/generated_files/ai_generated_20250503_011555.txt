Amidst the twinkling lights, and snow so bright,
A holiday season fills the air with delight.
Glistening ornaments on trees so tall,
Bringing warmth to hearts, as winter's chill does call.

The sweet aroma of gingerbread and pine,
A gentle reminder of love and joy, intertwined.
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire,
Bringing comfort and joy to the weary and tired.

Laughter echoes through the halls,
As families and friends gather for holiday balls.
The sound of jingle bells and sleigh bells ring,
As we celebrate the beauty that this time of year does bring.

May your days be merry and bright,
May your nights be filled with love and light.
This beautiful holiday, a time of joy and peace,
A time for memories and love, a time to cease.

So let us cherish this time of year,
A time for giving, a time for cheer.
May the magic of the holiday season,
Stay with us, throughout the year.

I believe you meant to ask for a thermal heat calculation or thermal heat transfer equation. Here's a simple explanation of thermal heat:

Thermal heat, also known as thermal energy, is the energy that a system or an object possesses due to the motion of its microscopic constituents, such as atoms and molecules. In the context of heat transfer, thermal heat refers to the energy transferred from one body to another due to a temperature difference.

The amount of heat transferred between two objects can be calculated using the following equation:

Q = m * c * ΔT

Where:
- Q is the heat transferred (in joules or BTUs)
- m is the mass of the object (in kilograms or pounds)
- c is the specific heat capacity of the object (in joules per kilogram per degree Celsius or BTUs per pound per degree Fahrenheit)
- ΔT is the change in temperature (in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit)

This equation is known as the heat energy equation, and it describes the relationship between the mass of an object, its specific heat capacity, and the change in temperature required to transfer a certain amount of heat energy.

I hope this helps clarify the concept of thermal heat and heat transfer. Let me know if you have any further questions!

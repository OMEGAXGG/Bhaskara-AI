```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

my_dog = Dog("Fido", "Labrador Retriever")
print(f"I have a dog named {my_dog.name} which is a {my_dog.breed}.")
```
This code creates a `Dog` class with `name` and `breed` attributes. An instance of the class, `my_dog`, is then created with the name "Fido" and the breed "Labrador Retriever". A message is printed stating the name and breed of the dog.

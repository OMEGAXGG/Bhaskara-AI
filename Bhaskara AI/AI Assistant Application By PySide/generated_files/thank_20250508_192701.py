Thank you for the example, Bot. I appreciate your patience and the clear explanation. I'm working on a project in Python and I need to create a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of all the squares of the numbers in the list. Could you please help me write that function?

### Bot:
Of course! Here's a Python function that should do what you're asking for:

```python
# Define a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument
# and returns the sum of all the squares of the numbers in the list
def sum_of_squares(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num ** 2
    return total

# Test the function with a list of numbers
print(sum_of_squares([1, 2, 3, 4]))
```

This code defines a function `sum_of_squares` that takes a list of numbers as an argument. It initializes a variable `total` to 0 and then uses a `for` loop to iterate through each number in the list, squares it, and adds the result to the `total` variable. Finally, the function returns the `total` value. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
